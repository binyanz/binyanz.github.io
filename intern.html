  <dt >2014.1-present <b> Testing Project for the communication availability of panel enclosure for Schneider Ltd.</b></dt>
  <dd> <i>The objective of the testing project is to assess the availability of several low power wireless technologies, 
  i.e., WiFi, Bluetooth, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), in the short range communicating in the Panel Box. </i></dd>
  	<ul>
  		<li> First period: portable point-to-point testing with BLE;</li>
  		<li> UDP/TCP communication with wifi module;</li> 
  		<li> Design a graphic UI for the wifi communication with C/C++;</li>
  		<li> Serial Port communications with bluetooth;</li> 		
  	</ul>
  <dt >2009.11-2010.11 <b> TD-LTE 1800 project and 230 project (Internship in Potevio Ltd. PRC)</b></dt>
  <dd> <i>1800 project aims at developing an electrical communication system for State Grid Corporation of China, 
  working on 1800MHz, implemented by DSP and FPGA. I completed several models in the company using C, 
  Assembly Language: </i></dd>
  	<ul>
  		<li> determine the scaling schedule for the data flow in FFT and IFFT module by simulation. 
  		The scaling schedule is an array of scale factors to be applied at the output of each stage of the FFT module 
  		so as to avoid overflow or underflow while computing.</li>
  		<li> Implementation, verification, and test of a synchronization module base on the received SNR data.</li> 	
  	</ul>
  <dd> <i>230 project aims at developing an LTE communication system with multi-core DSP devices, including the development 
  	of both transmitter and receiver of eNodeB and UE. The project involves a complete development procedure including 
  	algorithm design, float point and fix point simulation using C language, Assembly Language. Verification and integration 
  	testing was on PicoTools 7.4.3 on Linux.</i></dd>
  	<ul>
  		<li> De-rate matching module : which is the reverse procedure of  the  rate  matching for turbo coded transport 
  		channels as well as the convolution coded transport channels;</li>
  		<li> HARQ module: which is inspired by ACK-NACK message to determine to do retransmission or not, based upon the 
  		traditional Chase Combine technology; </li>
  	</ul>
  	<dt >2008.10-2009.10 <b> Research and Development of LTE system in the lab of the University</b></dt>
  <dd> <i>This project intends to build up the LTE telecommunication system using DSP, I completed several models using 
        C language, Assembly Language, and Matlab. </i></dd>
  	<ul>
  		<li> Pseudo- Random Sequence Generation engines; </li>
  		<li> Design, implementation, verification, and test of FFT module with transforming length of 2048 and 4096 
  		(including radix-2 and radix-4): particularly the 4096 FFT module used in PRACH channel detection, which is a 
  		competitive challenge because of its high data speed requirements and limitation of available hardware source;</li> 
  	</ul>
